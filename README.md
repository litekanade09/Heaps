# Heaps
This repository contains my exploration and implementation of Heaps in Data Structures using Java, focusing on their operations and practical applications.

Key Learnings

Types of Heaps:
Min Heap: The smallest element is at the root.
Max Heap: The largest element is at the root.

Heap Property:
Heaps are complete binary trees, making them efficient for array-based implementation.

Core Operations:
Insertion: Adding elements while maintaining the heap property.
Deletion: Removing the root and re-balancing the heap.

Heapify Process:
Used to restore the heap property after insertion or deletion.

Applications:
Implementing Priority Queues.
Efficiently solving problems like Kth Largest/Smallest Element.

Time Complexity:
Insert and delete operations are O(log N) due to tree height.

Sorting with Heaps:
Implemented Heap Sort with time complexity O(N log N).
